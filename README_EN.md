- **OpenAI API Key**: Required for using Whisper or GPT-4 Audio methods
- **Google API Key**: Required for using the Gemini method

#### Selection of Processing Method
- **Transcription Method**:
  - **Whisper Method**: OpenAI's speech recognition (low cost, lower quality)
  - **GPT-4 Audio Method**: OpenAI's high-precision speech recognition (approx. 30 yen for 10 minutes, high quality)
  - **Gemini Method**: Google's free API (free, high quality)

- **Minutes Generation Model**:
  - **OpenAI Method**: Uses OpenAI's model
  - **Gemini Method**: Uses Google's model

#### Other Settings
- **Seconds for Split Processing**: Unit for splitting long audio for processing (recommended: 300 seconds)

### üìã Customizing the Content of the Minutes

In the "Specify Minutes Content" tab, you can freely edit the prompts given to the AI. This allows you to specify the content and format you want to include in the minutes.

- **Minutes Generation Prompt**: Instructions to the AI on what kind of minutes to create
- **Reset Button**: Revert to the default prompt

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- Internet connection is required
- Google's free API key is used for learning, so use a paid API key for company use.
